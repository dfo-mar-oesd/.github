# Maritimes Region Ocean Ecosystem Science Division - GitHub Organizations

üåä Welcome to DFO Maritimes Region Ocean Ecosystem Science Division

This is the central hub for GitHub organizations supporting scientific research, data management, and ecosystem monitoring in Canada's Maritimes Region. Our work spans oceanographic research, marine ecosystem assessment, and the development of tools for sustainable ocean management.

## üè¢ Our GitHub Organizations

üî¨ [BIO-RSG (Bedford Institute of Oceanography - Remote Sensing Group)](https://github.com/BIO-RSG)

Remote sensing applications for ocean monitoring, satellite data processing, and development of tools for marine spatial analysis.

üåê [MarEcosystemApproaches](https://github.com/MarEcosystemApproaches)

Implementation of ecosystem approaches to marine management, including ecosystem modeling, indicator development, and integrated assessment tools.

üîç [VPRusers (Video Plankton Recorder)](https://github.com/VPRusers)

Tools and workflows for Video Plankton Recorder data processing, analysis, and visualization to support plankton ecology research.

### Monitoring Programs

üåä [DFOglider (Ocean Glider Program)](https://github.com/DFOglider)

Autonomous ocean glider operations, data processing pipelines, and tools for real-time oceanographic monitoring.

üìä [DFO-AZOMP (Atlantic Zone Off-shelf Monitoring Program)](https://github.com/DFO-AZOMP)


Off-shelf oceanographic monitoring data management, analysis tools, and reporting workflows for deep-water Atlantic ecosystems.

üìà [dfo-mar-azmp (Atlantic Zone Monitoring Program)](https://github.com/dfo-mar-azmp)
